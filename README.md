# Canadian Vineyard Site Selection

This app is live at https://canadianvineyards.streamlit.app/

This is the final project for my fall 2022 class GEOG466 - Geomedia and the Geoweb. The project was to create a web app that had an interactive map.
My idea was to compare canadian terroir to that of famous wine regions to tell the user which grapes they should try growing at their selected location.

This project was an excellent opportunity to learn raster processing using Google Earth Engine as well as some basic web dev.
I used Streamlit for the frontend of the project as it allowed me to write in pure python with some small HTML and CSS injections here and there, and focus more on the technical geographic aspects of the project.
